![](https://imgur.com/gpMfn6n.png)

## Overview
Grumpy cat is looking for a new job! Using what you know about HTML and CSS, help him by creating a resume website for him. (Note: You don't need to know 'real information' about Grumpy Cat -- just make things up!)

## Getting Started
- `Fork` and `clone` this repository
- `cd` into u1_lab_fake_resume
- Create your basic file structure

- Create an index.html file and add some boilerplate
```
touch index.html
```
  - in your `index.html` file type `html` or `!` and press tab to insert boilerplate.



- Create a style sheet:
```
touch main.css
```
  - Link your external style sheet to your HTML file

- View your website
```
open index.html     <--- MacOS
xdg-open index.html <--- Windows/Linux
```
  - Open your dev tools with  `cmd + option + i` (MacOS) or `ctrl + shift + i` (Windows/Linux).


## Initial Required Content
This is what Grumpy Cat wants you to include and do for his resume:

  - at least one header
  -  a professional image of Grumpy Cat ('img' tag)
  - at least one unordered list of his past three work positions ('ul' tag)
  - change the font _type_ in at least one place
  - change the background in at least one place
  - links for LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages ('a' tag). _You can set these to dummy links._
  - level-three heading tags to create labels for the work positions section and for the links section


:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added initial content for resume site"

## Adding Style
Add some style to your site and feel free to style it however you want! Here are some ideas:

1. Center your "h1" tag
1. Change the font of your "h1" tag
1. Change the color of the font of your "h3" tags
1. Add some space on the body of your application to make your site look more appealing.

Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added styling for resume site"

## Adding Navigation
1. Create a nav bar using the links to LinkedIn, Facebook/Twitter that you created earlier; Remove the old links section.
1. In the nav bar, add a link to the 'index.html' page (give it a name of `Home Page` in the bar).
1. Create another HTML file in this folder called 'projects.html'
2. Update your navbar with a link to 'projects.html' (maybe call this `Projects` in the bar)
1. Inside `projects.html` file, recreate your nav bar code so that _both_ `index.html` and `projects.html` have matching nav bars.
1. Inside `projects.html`, create a level-two heading with the text `Projects`
1. Check to make sure that your links work! When you click on "Projects" in your nav bar, does it open the `projects.html` document?
1. In `projects.html`, use an unordered list to add three projects that Grumpy Cat has worked on.

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added project.html page and content - finished resume"

1. In `projects.html`, create three columns: each column should contain the title and a description of one of Grumpy Cat's projects.
2. Insert a video of grumpy cat's work or his favorite YouTube video ('iframe' tag)
1. Add a level-three heading above his video with a title for the section
1. Insert a table with his contact info (`table` tag)
1. Add a level-three heading above his contact info with a title for the section

1. Give the image a 1px black border<br>
1. Give the body of the page a thicker border than the picture but only on the top and bottom of the page
1. Using HTML, insert a short blurb or biography with "p" tags
1. Using HTML, insert a short description above your "p" tag; use an "h3" tag
1. Make his name uppercase <strong>using CSS</strong>

1. Style the navigation bar
